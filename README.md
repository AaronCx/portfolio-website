## Reflection

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_

Static HTML Advantage Pre-generate all possible multiplication tables and store them in the HTML code. Use CSS to display/hide the desired table based on user input.The Disadvantage Requires significant upfront generation and maintenance of the HTML code for all possible table sizes, which can become impractical for large dimensions. It also limits flexibility and scalability.
